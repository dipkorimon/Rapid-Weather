We collect and process weather data.

Rapid Weather is a web application that provides users with real-time or forecasted weather information. This application is designed to help users stay informed about current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and other relevant meteorological data for a specific location or multiple locations.

Weather applications typically use data from meteorological agencies, weather stations, satellites, and weather models to provide accurate and up-to-date information. But Rapid Weather uses data from real-time API.
